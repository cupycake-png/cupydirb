# cupydirb
A tool for brute forcing web directories!

This is a tool written in python that's supposed to replicate the dirb tool!
The dirb tool is a way more sophisticated and effective tool but i thought it'd be fun to give a shot at replicating it ^^

The tool uses two threads and seperates the wordlist in two to allow for a quicker and more effective search through the directories!

Enjoy!! ^^
